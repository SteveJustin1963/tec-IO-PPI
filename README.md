# tec-PPI





## Abstract
TEC-1 addon PPI parallel input / output.

## Introduction 

2019 "Jim Robertson ... Interestingly, I found proof that the TEC-1 actually did support loading and parsing intel HEX files from the PC and actually had bi-directional bit-banged comms support at multiple baud rates. Therefore these things can be added to any revision without claims that it defeats the legacy scope of the TEC. ... Unfortunately, the source code is actually a barebones reconstruction from a disassembler and lacks comments. However, I tend to be able to read assembler as easy as plain English so it should be fun going through it all again. (Should I mention that I'm somewhat dyslexic?) :) I also found code that reminded me that I had plans to replace the EPROM with an EEPROM and so that new monitors could be "flashed" onboard the TEC. No UV eraser or, ahem, screwdriver required. There is code for a 8255 PPI based general purpose EPROM programmer included in the archive. Anyway, I've only glanced at the code so it all awaits a detailed review when I get home. Should be interesting!"
